        <h3><font color="FFFFFF">My Life</font></h3>
        <p><font color="FFFFFF">For the past 10 years I have been working in a retail
                                grocery store. I held many different roles including Executive Chef and
                                Associate Team Leader. At first it was fun and rewarding, but as the company
                               grew, the unique products they carried found their way to the competition.
                                The competition became prevalent, and affected the company nationwide. You
                                name it, it was eventually reduced or cut, and eventually so was I. It was a blessing in
                                disguise as it made me really look at my life and what I doing with it.
                                I have always been proficient with computers and have always enjoyed
                                learning more about technology. I started using some online resources and classes, which I really enjoyed.
                                And because of this, I decided I would get more serious about my education and to join a
                                coding bootcamp. I researched a few and had a few interviews but couldn't find one that fit what I was
                                looking for. One day, my amazing girlfriend, Monae suggested I look into a school she found, Galvanize, which
                                is just what I was looking for. This should be an educational and rewarding journey.</font></p>
