      <h3><font color="FFFFFF"><b>My Past</b></font></h3>
      <p> I spent a lot of time inside dairy coolers. For the past 6 years I have been throwing load, purchasing, and merchandising products,
         among other things. Before working in retail, I worked as an Executive Chef for 4 years and worked in
         kitchens for 10 years. I still love to cook and cook often, but I did not want to pursue cooking professionally.
         I am happy to be away from both of those fields and moving my life towards something I will really enjoy.</p>
