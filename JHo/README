These are my website files and the hangman game. hangman.js is ready to go. 
The website is three pages with a CSS file. All the pictures for the website are in the "Pics" folder. the HTML/CSS files
need to live in a folder named "Jho" and the pictures need to live a folder named "Pics". Put both folders into another 
folder and the website will work.
