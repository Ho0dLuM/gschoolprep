These are my pre-course projects. The website and the hangman game. 
The hangman.js file is stand alone and can be opened.
The website is in a few pieces. All the HTML and CSS files need to be put into a folder named "JHo" and all the pictures need to be put into a folder named "Pics". Once everything is consolidated into the two folders, put both of those folders into another folder and then the website will work.
